<a href="https://www.kion546.com/news/study-says-santa-cruz-county-has-second-highest-poverty-rate-in-the-state/775692263">The Scope of the Problem in Santa Cruz County</a>
1. Take a half or a third of the military's budget and invest it in the American school system.
<br />
<br />
2. Provide free healthcare for all Americans. When there is free healthcare, there is access to
<br />
birth control and then people can plan their families when they are older and can afford children. 
<br />
<br />
3. Create millions of jobs by investing in solar power and rebuilding our roads and bridges.
<br />
<br />
4. Elect scientists to become politicians and get rid of the uneducated, corrupt
<br />
ones and throughout the politicians that put religion in front of everything else.
