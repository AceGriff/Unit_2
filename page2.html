Scope of the Problem:
<br />
<br />
1 in 5 children live in poverty.   
<br />
<br />
People in poverty are more likely to have negative health outcomes,
<br />
lower levels of education, and are more likely to be incarcerated. 
<br />
<br />
People who are in poverty, often have a shorter lifespan then those who do not.
<br />
<br />
13.5% of Americans (43.1million) live in poverty.
<br />
-CDC 2015
<br />
<br />
Poverty often impacts education, graduation rates, and future economic success.
